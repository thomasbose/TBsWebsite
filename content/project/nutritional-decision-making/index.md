Organisms frequently select activities,
which relate to economic, social and perceptual decision-making problems.
The choices made may have substantial impact on their lives.
In foraging decisions, for example,
animals aim at reaching a target intake of nutrients;
it is generally believed
that a balanced diet improves reproductive success,
yet little is known about the underlying mechanisms
that integrate nutritional needs within the brain.

In our study, we addressed this coupling between
physiological states and a decision-making circuit 
in the context of foraging decisions.
We considered 
a model animal that has the drive to eat or drink.
The motivation to select and perform one 
of these activities (i.e. eating or drinking),
is processed in artificial neuronal units
that have access to information on how hungry and thirsty the animal is 
at the point it makes the decision.
We showed that inhibitory and excitatory mechanisms 
in the neural circuit shape ongoing binary
decisions, and we revealed under which conditions 
oscillating motivations may improve 
the overall performance of the animal.
Our results indicate that inefficient decision making
may originate from suboptimal modulation of excitation 
and inhibition in the neurobiological network.
