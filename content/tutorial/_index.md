This Tutorial page is primarily intended to present some simple use cases that demonstrate how to employ our software tool [*MuMoT*](/softwareitem/mumot/) developed at the University of Sheffield as part of the [DiODe](http://diode.group.shef.ac.uk) project. All the examples worked through are implemented in Jupyter notebooks.

In the menu on the left-hand side you can navigate through different topics.
