Computer code for data generation accompanies our recent [Publication in the *Neural Computation* journal](/publication/inhibition-and-excitation-shape-activity-selection/). The code is open source and available via [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/DiODeProject/Inhibition-and-excitation-shape-activity-selection).
