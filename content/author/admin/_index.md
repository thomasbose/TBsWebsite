I am a Research Fellow in the Behavioural and Evolutionary Theory Lab in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Sheffield where I work on the [DiODe Project](https://diode.group.shef.ac.uk/). At present, my research focuses on the theory of collective decision making and the development of computational approaches to explain and describe the underlying mechanisms allowing complex systems to reach consensus. In particular, I am interested in understanding the relationships between external stimuli and their internal representations that drive behavioural choices in perceptual as well as value-based decision-making tasks. 
In my spare time, I enjoy discover the outdoors with my family or work on a small obstacle-avoiding car with my older son.
